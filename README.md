# OSCP_exam_cheatsheet

Hi this is the cheatsheet I used in my OSCP exam and lucky for me I was able to pass the exam on my first try! Feel free to download it if you are interested.

This cheatsheet not only included some of the command that is commonly used, it also include some tips and tricks that I found out through out my OSCP journey.
